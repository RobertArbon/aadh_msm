 CHARMM>    ! NAME: solvent-box.str
 CHARMM>    ! PURPOSE: make a TIP3 box with user-defined edges, and make room for solute
 CHARMM>    ! AUTHOR: Lennart Nilsson, Karolinska Institutet (October 7, 2003)
 CHARMM>    ! THERE IS NO ERROR CHECKING IN THIS FILE
 CHARMM>    ! Dynamic segment generation added for those CHARMM versions, which do not
 CHARMM>    ! support more than 9999 residues per segment . Modification
 CHARMM>    ! by Davit Hakobyan (October 1, 2004).
 CHARMM>     
  
 CHARMM>    !ASSUMPTIONS:
 CHARMM>    ! The psf and coordinates of the solute are present
 CHARMM>    ! A selection "SOLUTE" defining the solute has been made
 CHARMM>    ! (define solute sele ... end)
 CHARMM>    ! There is no segment present with segid WAT, WAT0, WAT1, WAT2 or WAT3
 CHARMM>    ! XSIZ, YSIZ and ZSIZ have been s set to the desired box dimensions
 CHARMM>    ! Uses $CHM_STREAM/read-watbox.str to get coordinates for primary water box
 CHARMM>    ! Unix environment variable CHM_STREAM points to directory containing these
 CHARMM>    ! scripts
 CHARMM>    !RESULT:
 CHARMM>    ! At return there will be a new segment named WAT containing TIP3 water
 CHARMM>    ! molecules ! that have their oxygen atom in the box, and not overlapping
 CHARMM>    ! with the solute.
 CHARMM>    ! The system is centered at the origin, with the main axis of inertia of the
 CHARMM>    ! SOLUTE! along the x-axis. For the deletion of overlapping waters only
 CHARMM>    ! heavy solute atoms and water oxygens are considered; overlap distance
 CHARMM>    ! criteria are defined below
 CHARMM>    ! No other manipulations (minimizations etc) are performed on the system;
 CHARMM>    ! bomblevel is set to -2 to avoid stopping at empty selections or
 CHARMM>    !  empty segments
 CHARMM>    ! 2004.10.01 modification
 CHARMM>    ! For those segments, which threaten to contain more than 9999 residues per segment
 CHARMM>    ! new segment name is created. This results in some changes in water segments
 CHARMM>    ! names. For current modification water segments start with name WT followed by
 CHARMM>    ! a number starting from 2. Due to intermediate deletion and generation of atoms
 CHARMM>    ! and segments the final structure may not contain water segment starting from
 CHARMM>    ! strictly WT2 and may contain gap in segment naming. Modification could be mostly
 CHARMM>    ! found if search for "Auto_naming" comment line.
