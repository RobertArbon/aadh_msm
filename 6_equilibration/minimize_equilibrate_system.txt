systems were minimized using 
a 4-step protocol in which the water molecules were allowed to
associate with the macromolecule before allowing the macro-
molecule to move. These steps were: heavy atoms fixed (2,000
steps), heavy atoms fixed excluding water and ions (3,000 steps),
macromolecule backbone atoms fixed (5,000 steps), and all
atoms free to move (20,000 steps). During the initial equilibra-
tion, the system was gradually heated to 298 K (12, 14) during
which different parts of the system were harmonically con-
strained. The initial temperature was set to 100 K, and ions and
heavy atoms in the protein and nucleic acid chains were har-
monically constrained for the first 25,000 fs. Then the temper-
ature was raised to 200 K, and backbone atoms were harmon-
ically constrained for 25,000 fs. Force constants for all harmonic
constraints were set to 1 kcal molϪ1Å2. Finally, the temperature
was raised to 298 K, and all atoms were freed for the next 3.9 ns.

A four-step energy
minimization was employed for both apo and holo structures to
ensure maximal retention of experimental structural informa-
tion. The four steps constrained heavy atoms for 1000 fs, heavy
atoms excluding water for 1000 fs, backbone atoms excluding
all other molecular groups for 2500 fs, and finally a constraint-
free motion of all atoms for 5000 fs. Harmonic constraints were
induced to allow minimal backbone motion to achieve water
equilibration for five time frames of 25 000 fs each and different
backbone constraint constants of 1.0, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25, and 0.0
kcal mol−1 Å.

2.4 Fixed atoms
	To fix all atoms of protein and DNA you can use VMD. After loading your system: ionized.psf
	and ionized.pdb, in the VMD TkCon window type:
		set all [atomselect top all]
		set prot [atomselect top protein]
		set dna [atomselect top nucleic]
	after that, you have to type the following:
		$all set beta 0
		$dna set beta 1
		$prot set beta 1
	And finally:
		$all writepdb protein-dna-fixed.pdb
	You may want to inspect the protein-dna-fixed.pdb using WordPad. In the column for B
	factors, you should see value 1 instead of zero.

2.5 Harmonic constraints (Positional restraints)
	To add harmonic restraints on a protein on C alpha atoms and DNA you can use VMD program.
	The procedure is very similar to the one for fixed atoms.
		set all [atomselect top all]
		set prot [atomselect top “protein and name CA”]
		set dna [atomselect top nucleic]
	after that, you have to type the following:
		$all set beta 0
		$dna set beta 500
		$prot set beta 500
	And finally:
		$all writepdb proteinCA-DNA-const500.pdb
	You may want to inspect the proteinCA-DNA-const500.pdb using WordPad. In the column for B-
	factors, you should see value 500 instead of zero.

3. Common scenario of simulations
	In each directory (Stage1 Stage2 etc) there is configuration file, which should be filled out
	with missing settings (option add me ). For verification purposes, each directory contains a subdirectory
	example-output that is composed of a set of input and output files for given stage.
	Each stage is continuation of a previous stage; therefore output coordinate file from one stage is input
	coordinate for next stage. Because of time constrains of workshop we just fill configuration files and
	run given stage with smaller number of steps. For next stage we will use output files from
	example-output subdirectory.
	Run each stage of your simulation by typing in a Terminal window:
	namd2 configfilename.conf > configfilename.log
	Run the following steps as an exercise in subdirectories STAGE1,STAGE2 etc, respectively
	
3.1 Stage 1 Minimization – Holding the solute fixed
	Using “fixed atoms parameters” with constant pressure periodic boundary simulations, leads to
	instabilities and strange artifacts. Due to these reasons, this it is no longer suggested method. Instead
	we will use “positional restraints” on each of the DNA atoms and on C-alpha atoms of proteins. Only
	the water and ions are minimized. We will run 1000steps, Temp=0K, using a force constant of 500 kcal
	mol-1Å-2 .
	
3.2 Stage 2 - Minimization of the entire system
	We will run 2,500 steps of minimization without the restraints this time. Note, choosing the number of
	minimization steps to run is a bit of a "black of art". Running too few leads to instabilities when you
	start running MD. Running too many will not cause any real harm since we will just get closer to the
	nearest local minima. It will, however, waste cpu time. Since minimization is generally very quick with
	respect to the molecular dynamics it is often a good idea to run more minimization steps than really
	necessary. Here, 2,500 should be enough.
	
3.3 Stage 3 - Molecular Dynamics (heating) with restraints on the solute (NVT ensemble)
	Now that we have successfully minimized our system, the next stage in our equilibration protocol is
	allow our system to heat up from 0 K to 310 K increasing by 5 K every 2000 steps. In order to ensure
	this happens without any wild fluctuations in our solute we will use a weak restraints, as we did in
	stage 1 of minimization, on the solute (DNA and C-alpha atoms of protein). We will use the Langevin
	thermostat to maintaining temperature.
	
3.4 Stage 4 - Running MD Equilibration on the whole system (NPT ensemble)
	Now that we have successfully heated our system at constant volume with weak restraints on the DNA
	and C-alpha of protein, the next stage is to switch constant pressure, so that the density of our water can
	relax. At the same time we are at 310 K; therefore we can safely remove the restraints on our DNA and
	protein. We will run this equilibration for 250 ps to give our system plenty of time to relax.
