This outlines the procedure for sampling the reactive conformations using a selection of the AADH enzyme. 


1. Prepare the reactive geometry psf/pdb/crd from 2agy_sol_ion.pdb created by KR.
    We're including the crystal waters but not the bulk water (add this later) 
2. Optional (if using EVB) prepare the reactant state psf/pdb/crd.  
3. Truncate full system to 25 A around the NT of TTQ/TRP 
3.
